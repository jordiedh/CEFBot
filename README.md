# CEF Bot
## Project Overview
This bot was made as a custom Discord bot to have a workspace for the [Collective Empowerment Foundation charity](https://collectiveempowermentfoundation.org/).
The main feature of this bot is so the team can initiate votes where all of the team members can vote on any given topic/subject, such as financing specific things, bringing in new rules, etc. in coordination with charity guidelines.
The bot utilises NodeJS, TypeScript, SQLite and JSON for the build.
## Disclaimer/Information
I didn't use commits (woops) when first creating this project, so the first initial build is just a massive chunk of code.
This repository serves more as a demonstration of my work for potential employers, but you are free to use this code as you wish.
